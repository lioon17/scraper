Here's a concise breakdown of the key sections in the scraper code and their functions:

1. Class Constructor (constructor)
javascript
constructor(config = {}) {
  this.config = { /* default settings */ ...config };
  this.scrapedData = [];
  this.requestCount = 0;
}
Function: Initializes scraper with default/custom settings

Purpose: Centralized configuration for URL, rate limits, output file, etc

Key Parameters:

rateLimit: Delay between requests (anti-blocking)

headless: Browser visibility mode

outputFile: Data storage location

2. Robots.txt Checker (checkRobotsTxt)
javascript
async checkRobotsTxt() {
  // Fetches and logs robots.txt
}
Function: Checks scraping permissions

Purpose: Ethical compliance and risk assessment

Output: Warns if scraping might violate site policies

3. Static Content Scraper (scrapeStatic)
javascript
async scrapeStatic(url, selector) {
  // Uses Axios + Cheerio
}
Function: Scrapes standard HTML pages

Key Features:

Realistic browser headers (User-Agent)

CSS selector targeting

Lightweight processing

4. Dynamic Content Scraper (scrapeDynamic)
javascript
async scrapeDynamic(url, selector) {
  // Uses Puppeteer
}
Function: Handles JavaScript-rendered content

Key Features:

Full browser emulation

Waits for elements to load

Executes in-page JavaScript

Automatic resource cleanup

5. Pagination Handler (scrapePagination)
javascript
async scrapePagination() {
  while(hasNextPage) { ... }
}
Function: Crawls through multiple pages

Safety Features:

Page limit (prevents infinite loops)

Rate limiting between pages

Empty page detection

6. Retry Mechanism (scrapeWithRetry)
javascript
async scrapeWithRetry() {
  for(let attempt=1; attempt<=maxRetries; attempt++)
}
Function: Error resilience system

Purpose: Handles temporary network failures

Strategy: Exponential backoff delay between retries

7. Data Saver (saveData)
javascript
saveData() {
  fs.writeFileSync(...)
}
Function: Stores collected results

Output: Structured JSON file

Extension Point: Easy to modify for CSV/DB formats

8. Main Orchestrator (run)
javascript
async run() {
  await this.checkRobotsTxt();
  // Initial scrape
  await this.scrapePagination();
  this.saveData();
}
Function: Coordinates scraping workflow

Execution Flow:

Permission check

Initial page scrape

Pagination handling

Data persistence

Performance reporting

9. Execution Wrapper (IIFE)
javascript
(async () => {
  const scraper = new WebScraper();
  await scraper.run();
})();
Function: Safe instantiation and execution

Features:

Async context for modern JS

Isolated scope

Error containment

Key System Interactions:
Ethical Compliance: Robots.txt check → Legal protection

Anti-Blocking: User-Agent + Rate limiting → Avoid detection

Content Handling:

Static: Axios/Cheerio → Efficiency

Dynamic: Puppeteer → Accuracy

Fault Tolerance: Retry mechanism → Reliability

Data Integrity: Structured collection → Usable output

This architecture provides a balanced approach between scraping effectiveness, ethical compliance, and code maintainability while offering clear extension points for more complex scenarios.
